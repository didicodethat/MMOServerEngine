# Tile based MMO server engine
This is a prototype for a Tile Based MMO Server engine inspired by games like Ragnarok Online and RuneScape. This is project is supposed to be client agnostic, so you would still need to implement your own game client in your game engine of choice.

## What this project aims to have:
  - User authentication and authorization
  - Scriptable server side entities
    - Monsters
    - NPCs
        - Conversations
        - Stores
  - Player Chat

Currently it's on a really stage so none of those features are actually implemented.
